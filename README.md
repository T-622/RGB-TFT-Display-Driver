# RGB-TFT-Display-Driver
About:
A basic example of a color driver for the Terasic Cyclone 3 NIOS 2 evaluation TFT LCD.

Requirements:
- Terasic NIOS II Cyclone III development kit with TFT LCD.
- Download cable / appropriate software

Usage:
- 2 Files have been included with the design; "displayDriver" and "displayDriver_TB", the former being the VHDL file containing the display color test, and the _TB, being a testbench.

Simulation:
- To simulate under Modelsim, compile the 2 included VHDL design files into a library called "tftDriver". Simulate only the TB file.

Tested:
- Developed under Quartus II 13.0 SP1
- Simulated with ModelSim-Altera 10.1d
